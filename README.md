# 🌍 Global Climate Change Dashboard

An interactive dashboard built using **Streamlit**, **Plotly**, and **ARIMA** time series modeling to visualize and forecast **CO₂ emissions** by country. The project allows users to upload datasets, filter by country and year, view trends, and forecast future emissions.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **Time Series Forecasting** of global CO₂ emissions using ARIMA
- 🌐 **World Map Visualization** (Choropleth) of average emissions by country
- 📊 **Line Chart of Country-Wise Emissions Trends**
- 📥 **Downloadable CSV** of filtered data
- 📅 **Year Range and Country Filters** via sidebar
- 📄 Descriptive interface with Markdown and metric summaries
